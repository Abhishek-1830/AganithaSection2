# AganithaSection2
Solution for Section 2 programming exercise. OO Solution for second exercise of Section 2

This is the Object Oriented Solution for second exercise of Section 2 of the Test.

# There are 2 files: Solution.py and Solution.ipynb

# Executing Solution1.py
Solution.py file can be access directly from command line.
Just go to the terminal/command-line, 
type: python Solution.py
(if you are using latest version of python i.e. version greater than 3, then use: 'python3' instead of python)
For python versions greater than 3,
type: python3 Solution.py

Possible Issue: You may need to grant permissions to execute this python file. So, make sure you have those permissions. 
You may try executing the following in case of an issue with permissions:
chmod +x Solution1.py

# Executing Solution1.ipynb
This a Python Notebook file. 
So, you can execute this file by opening it using any of the notebook, for instance, Jupyter Notebook, Spyder or VS Code

# What's in the program?
In this program, we are playing with 3 different classes, namely: A, B and C.
We can CREATE as many objects of the classes, EXECUTE those objects and DELETE those objects.

The tasks you can perform repetitively are:
a. Create an object of the chosen class with given name
b. Delete an object with a given name
c. Run the execute method of a named object with the given arguments

You'll be prompted with necessary arguments whenever needed.

# Inputs and Outputs
At every step, you'll be prompted about the inputs, so need not worry about the Input and Output formats.


Have a good day!
